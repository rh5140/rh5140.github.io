I worked with my team members to establish the game concept and wrote the dialogue for the game. I also included notes for where an interaction, animation, or sound effect would be appropriate and placed all interactables such that the dialogue and movement direction would naturally lead the player to them in the intended order. I compensated for features we didn\'t implement in time through the dialogue, and I\'m proud that our game was narratively complete in the end! I felt more satisfied finishing "Cranky." than any of the previous games I\'d worked on, even though those other games were more polished, because figuring out how to create the experience I wanted players to have was a fun puzzle for me to solve.'))}}]);
