  A VR experience in which you explore a dreamy world full of sleeping animals, developed solo with music by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvin-liu-b183b31b9">Alvin Liu</a>, my friend and creative collaborator. This project was developed for <a href="https://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Winter24/172/">Design | Media Arts 172: Virtual Reality and Worldbuilding</a> at UCLA, taught by Professor Jenna Caravello and TA Antigoni Tsagkaropoulou.
  
  <p><b>Timeline:</b> Jan - March 2024 (10 weeks)</p>

  <p><b>Tools:</b> Unity 3D, Visual Studio Code (C#), Git/Github, MediBang Paint, Blender, Figma</p>

  <p>Play the game on <a href="https://raddishradish.itch.io/nebulosus-reverie">itch.io</a> and check out the <a href="https://github.com/rh5140/DMA-172">GitHub repo</a>! The project is configured for HTC Vive and Oculus, but I also uploaded WebGL, Windows, and Mac builds using a first-person controller to make the project more accessible.</p>

const NebulosusAlt = "This gif moves around in a pink, cloudy world. There is a blob-shaped tree 3D model and a 2D animation of a sleeping leopard on a cloud. As the camera moves closer to the leopard, it becomes startled, changing its animation to be alert and clouds forming around its spots. The camera moves away from the leopard."

const FizzBuzzSpan =
<span>
  A character with support abilities designed for a group board game, developed solo from January - February 2024 (3 weeks) for <a href="https://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Winter24/157/">Design | Media Arts 157: Game Design</a> at UCLA.

  <p>My first foray into physical fabrication, in which I learned how to use Adobe Illustrator and wood glue! I'm particularly proud of the detachable hat.</p>

  <p>With enough energy, Fizz Buzz can cast spells empowered by adjacent allies. After falling below an energy threshold, Fizz Buzz loses his ability to cast spells (and with it, the hat on his token.)</p>

</span>

const FizzBuzzAlt = "This gif swaps between several photos. They include a wooden character piece of a yellow gecko sitting on a tree wearing a purple wizard hat. The gecko, dubbed Fizz Buzz the Wizard Lizard, has an associated character card and character information sheet, along with cards and tracker tokens."

const ArtAlt = "A gif that swaps between three frames. The first frame is a digital illustration of an Alolan Exeggutor designed as a Monster Hunter monster, formatted like a page out of a book. The second is a digital painting of a Flareon curled around a Torchic, sleeping on a pile of blankets. There is a heart made of fire above them. The final frame contains 3 digital drawings in a polygonal style. The one on the left is a shiny Rayquaza on a black background. The one on the top right is a Krokorok with sunglasses, arms crossed under the desert sun. The one on the bottom right is an Empoleon pointing at the viewer with a wing, with a background of geometric ice shapes."

const RaybladesSpan = 
<span>
  This Beyblades simulation was developed for Computer Science 174A: Introduction to Computer Graphics, taught by Professor Ashish Law and TA Chenda Duan, with two other students.

  <p><b>Timeline:</b> March 2023 (2.5 weeks)</p>

  <p><b>Tools:</b> JavaScript, WebGL, <a href="https://github.com/niyantn/tiny-graphics-js">tiny-graphics.js</a></p>

  <p>Run it in your browser on this <a href="https://rh5140.github.io/174a-beyblades/">webpage</a> (sound on!) and check out the <a href="https://github.com/rh5140/174a-beyblades">GitHub repo</a>!</p>
</span>

const RaybladesAlt = "A gif of two Beyblades spinning around on a marble platform with a background of spinning fire."

const CorgoSpan = 
<span>
  This animation was developed for Computer Science 174C: Computer Animation, taught by Professor Demetri Terzopoulos and TA Zhi Li, with three other students.

  <p><b>Timeline:</b> February - March 2024 (5 weeks)</p>

  <p><b>Tools:</b> JavaScript, WebGL, <a href="https://github.com/niyantn/tiny-graphics-js">tiny-graphics.js</a></p>

</span>

const CorgoAlt = "A gif of a frog jumping on a mushroom in an environment of red mushrooms and frogs. It zooms in on the frog, then zooms out to see a corgi is running circles around the frog."

const RaddishSpan =
<span>
  This clicker game was developed from May - June 2024 (1.5 weeks) for <a href="https://www.cs130.org/">Computer Science 130: Software Engineering</a>, with three other students. 
  
  <p>This version I have online is mostly meant to demonstrate my contributions to the frontend and is disconnected from the backend. I designed the game elements, designed and implemented the webpage, and drew the art assets.</p>

  <p>Run it in your browser on this <a href="https://rh5140.github.io/raddish/">webpage</a>. The frontend display branch can be seen here <a href="https://github.com/rh5140/raddish/tree/frontend-display">on GitHub</a>.</p>
</span>

const RaddishAlt = "A gif of a clicker game featuring a large radish to click on. The buyable upgrades include cat farmer, farmer, taffy, Charlie the parrot, almond, lobster, and Powell cat."

const PlateSpan =
<span>
  A board game project was developed solo from February - March 2024 (3 weeks) for <a href="https://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Winter24/157/">Design | Media Arts 157: Game Design</a> at UCLA.

  <p>The gameplay was intended to simulate the positive feedback loop of getting more and more overwhelmed and stressed, but the gameplay didn't accurately reflect that. If I had more time and resources, I would experiment with different materials to make it physically difficult to lift the pieces â€“ my character tokens were too stable and sturdy, and the tokens were far too light.</p>

  <p>At least it makes for <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TsMWvrJxPb1QTYfpJ_MggEPiGn8N6sxq/view">a cool art piece</a>.</p>

</span>

const PlateAlt = "This gif swaps between several photos of a board game. This board game is made up of 4 staircases, colored red, blue, yellow, and green, that converge to a white platform. The character pieces placed on the staircase are students carrying plates, and there are clay tokens of different shapes on their plates."

const KazziSpan = 
<span>
  <p>A mascot designed for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/magical-in-gaming">MAGICAL in Gaming</a>, a community of marginalized genders in gaming club alumni. Visual inspirations include magical girl companions and the MAGICAL logo, and the name is a diminutive of "alakazam."</p>
</span>

const KazziAlt = "A character sheet of Kazzi, a rabbit-like creature with no legs and floating arms, holding a wand and wearing a purple cape and purple mask shaped like a game controller"

const PMTAlt = "A collage of art of an anthropomorphic milk tea character"
