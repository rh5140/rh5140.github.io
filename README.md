# [rh5140.github.io](https://rh5140.github.io/)
Ray Hsiao's personal website built using [Gatsby framework](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). To be periodically updated. 

[rayhsiao.gatsbyjs.io](https://rayhsiao.gatsbyjs.io) is currently behind the GitHub pages version because importing images is causing errors in Gatsby Cloud for some reason :( (wasn't a problem before)
