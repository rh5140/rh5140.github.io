# [rh5140.github.io](https://rh5140.github.io/)
Ray Hsiao's personal website built using [Gatsby framework](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Cool domain that was a pain to set up: [rayhsiao.dev](https://rayhsiao.dev) (shoutout to [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundryVTT/comments/o9zz1u/setting_up_ssl_using_google_domains_not_cloud_w/))

To be periodically updated. 

Also found at [rayhsiao.gatsbyjs.io](https://rayhsiao.gatsbyjs.io), but Gatsby Cloud is ending its service. Now on Netlify: [https://melodic-toffee-7b55a1.netlify.app/](https://melodic-toffee-7b55a1.netlify.app/)

## Notes to self
Develop on `source` branch

Run `gatsby develop` to start the local development server http://localhost:8000/

Run `npm run deploy` to deploy
